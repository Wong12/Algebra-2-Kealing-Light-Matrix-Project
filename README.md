# Algebra-2-Kealing-Light-Matrix-Project

Hey ashton: you will have to set up travis and possibly slack since you're the repo owner.

Also, you might want to remove this repo once we're done testing and start again, since we have two extraneous contributors

Question for everyone: Does everyone have a Google/Gmail account (not the school one) that works with Hangouts: https://goo.gl/forms/bGyzhrGOgLZGTNeX2
I'd rather use hangouts if we could
