# Algebra-2-Kealing-Light-Matrix-Project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Wong12/Algebra-2-Kealing-Light-Matrix-Project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Wong12/Algebra-2-Kealing-Light-Matrix-Project)

Please don't put code in the main area. The only document should be README.md and .travis.yml
All source code should be in the right folder and subfolder to ensure that it's checked.

Right now, Travis is only checking to see if the code compiles (Check for integration syntax errors). TODO: Check for integration functional errors, check for integration lint...Get this to work in Codenvy.
